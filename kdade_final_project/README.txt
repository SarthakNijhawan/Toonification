Final Project - Toonify

As mentioned in the project proposal, the target device for the source code is the Google Nexus 7 tablet. This is the only device that the application has been tested on, and any demos will be performed on this device. Furthermore, the camera and image-save functionalities of the application are unsupported at the time of this submission. To use the app, please make sure any images you wish to process are in the gallery before starting the app (take pictures with native camera app, download pictures from internet, upload pictures from computer). Once the Toonify app is started, you can browse the gallery to select which image you would like to process.

Images that yield good results:
-Large blocks of color
-Sharp, long edges
-Minimal local detail
